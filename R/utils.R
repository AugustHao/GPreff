#' get a matrix to use for forward convolution, given the mass function(s) (integrating to 1 for
#' convolution) and the number of timepoints to convolve. This function can take either a single

#' necessary when the delay mass function is time varying. Note that we need to think about if we
#' should make explicit if the user is inputting a single mass function or a list of mass functions
